            1: I picked images that best showed some nice ring options that people could have.
            2: I communicated with my developer through email
            3: My developer met my expectations
            4: Next time I hire a team I will find a way to better communicate to the whole team

           <p>
            1: I communicated through github
            2: I communicated through email and did not have too many issues getting in contact with my Client
            3: I was able to publish the site on github and send the link to my Client
            4: It was difficult to learn how to use github. I am still struggling with it

           <h2>Junior Dev Report</h2>
           <p>
            1: I communicated through github and there were usually no issues
            2: I knew what was expected of me for each site
            3: I was able to contribute to the sites I made
            4: The only issue I ran into was github not updating right away. Even after I had pushed the changes it would take a few minutes for the link on github to update properly.

           <h2>
            1: The most challenging part of this project was trying to learn how to use github. Although I figured out how to use it basically, I am still strugling to learn how to use it more proficiently.
            2: I enjoyed being able to make a website and actually be able to access it outside of liveserver!
            3: If I could do one thing differently it would be to find a more efficient way to communicate with the other people that I was working with.
            4: I feel much more confident when it comes to other real-world projects. Now that I know the basics and I have also seen that I am capable of doing larger projects I am less worried about future jobs.
